    <p> Hello fellow geeks and Nerds, My name is Nick Skonberg and I am a definite geek/nerd. This website will be just a souirce for geek news, culture, and events.</p>
    
  <p> The 2015 summer blockbuster season started with Avengers: Age of Ultron and will end with Fantastic Four. Franchises such as the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) Pitch Perfect, and Despicable Me are continuing their franchises while others such as Jurassic Park Mad Max, and The Terminator are all reviving their franchise with a new addition. 
    
  <p> Then there are movies that could be starting a franchise or just a one time thing. These movies include Pixels, Fantastic Four, Spy, and Tommorowland, They all have the potential and Box office money but only time can tell.
    
   <p> Thank you for reading and I hope you will tune in in the future until then May the force be with you and Allons-y
